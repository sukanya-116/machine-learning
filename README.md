📘 Credit Card Fraud Detection using XGBoost

A complete ML pipeline with training, evaluation, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and Dockerized model deployment.

🚀 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end Credit Card Fraud Detection system leveraging the popular Kaggle credit-card dataset.
The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Train/Validation/Test splits with stratification

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Class imbalance handling using XGBoost’s scale_pos_weight

Hyperparameter tuning (depth × learning rate grid)

Final training on full dataset

Model evaluation on unseen test data

Exporting the trained model

Deploying prediction API via FastAPI inside a Docker container

The goal is to demonstrate a production-ready machine learning pipeline suitable for fintech fraud detection systems.

🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework optimized for tabular data. Key design choices:

Algorithm: binary:logistic

Evaluation Metric: AUC

Tuned hyperparameters:

eta (learning rate)

max_depth

scale_pos_weight → handles heavy class imbalance

Final model trained on combined Train + Validation dataset

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset

Rows: 284,807

Fraud Cases: 492 (0.172%) → highly imbalanced

Features: PCA components V1–V28 + Time + Amount

Target:

0 → Non-fraud

1 → Fraud

🔧 Model Training Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing

Remove duplicates

Train/Validation/Test Split

Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

Oversampling is not required (XGBoost handles imbalance well)

2. Hyperparameter Tuning

Grid search over:

max_depth ∈ {2, 3, 6}
eta       ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 0.5}


Selects best combination based on validation AUC.

3. Full Model Training

Recompute scale_pos_weight on full training set

Train with tuned parameters

🧪 Evaluation Results

Example output (your results may vary):

Final Test AUC: 0.9981

              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       1.00      1.00      1.00     56861
           1       0.92      0.85      0.88       101


The model achieves high recall & precision for detecting fraudulent transactions.

💾 Saving the Model

The trained XGBoost model is saved as:

model_final.save_model("fraud_model.json")


This file is included in the Docker image for deployment.

🌐 Deployment with Docker
1. Build the image
docker build -t fraud-detector .

2. Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 fraud-detector


The FastAPI service is now available at:

http://localhost:8000/predict

🔌 API Usage

📌 Example request:

You can send a POST request to the FastAPI server using a Python script - predict-test.py

📌 Example Output

When the API is running (uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000), running the test script prints something like:

Status Code: 200
Response JSON: {
    "probability": 0.9999877214431763,
    "risk": true
}

➡️ risk: true means the model flagged the transaction as potential fraud.
